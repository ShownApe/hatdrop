# hatdrop
working method to give hats collision in roblox, brought to you by [gee cee](https://www.roblox.com/groups/34681971/gee-cee#), made solely by shownape

this DOES need you to both have a hat equipped on your avatar and an executor with access to sethiddenproperty / setscriptable. also i should state that 99% of accessories not attached to your head seem to not drop, im sure theres a solution but im yet to implement it.

also this uses fallen parts destroy height and is just overall janky in nature, ive tried my hardest to make it stable / consistent but there still is a chance of failing, and it works better in some games more than others. i am releasing this as a resource, however i did attempt to make the hatfling.lua user friendly

there are 3 files, one literally just drops ur hats in front of you (like when you used to parent to workspace), one that flings using my accessory, and a file that just has the bare amount of code to make hats collide without anything else (added as a resource for making your own scripts with it)

if you arent using this as a resource for your own scripts, i recommend only using the hatfling.lua script. you can get the hat meant to be used with it that will fling everyone in a 2048 stud radius (a LOT, over 341x as big as an r6 character) here: https://www.roblox.com/catalog/18875660360/2048hat and or join my server at https://discord.gg/XR6kEcDhtU
